Item name: `eg. Hi-Potion`

Before opening this issue, please be 100% sure that the item you are reporting is the correct one. 
To prove the item name, you can set a specific amount and see if in-game the value is there, or you set the amount of all your inventory to 0 but this item. The in-game inventory should be empty and the only item is the one you were searching for.
