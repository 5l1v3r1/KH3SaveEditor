## How to use it
You need first to get a decrypted save. There are two ways to achieve it:

1) Playstation 4 Save Mounter: If you have a PS4 with a HEN or Custom Firmware, you may want to use this free and fast tool: https://github.com/ChendoChap/Playstation-4-Save-Mounter

2) Save Wizard: If you do not have a custom firmware, you can obtain a copy of a decrypted save and re-encrypt it using the following paid software: https://www.savewizard.net/

Once you get your save, just open it using the KH3SaveEditor from File\Open, then save it with File\Save. If you want to transfer back the file on your Playstation 4, just follow the guide lines of the tool that you used for decryption

## Contribute to make it better

This software is open-source, and every contribution is more than welcome!

If you want to add missing names, improve it or add new offsets, just clone the repository, do your change, test if it does work and create a pull request: we will review your change (no needs to be scared here) and we will merge it to this repo!
